# FireGallery

An image gallery web application to manage images (like postimages or imagebb). We can upload local image, delete, copy url, see live gallery etc. 

This project is developed and designed by *Rahat Faruk* (me). I wanted to explore more about react and firebase through this project.  

**Tech**: react 18, tailwindcss, firebase (storage, realtime-db), bootstrap-icons

## Features:
  - upload local img
  - delete
  - copy url
  - live gallery
  - loading on fetch 
  - verify if the file is a valid image type
  - albums: create, delete album; group images based on album
